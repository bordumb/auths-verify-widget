## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **resolver:** Auto-resolve identity and attestation data from a repository URL via new `repo` attribute. No more manual JSON — `<auths-verify repo="https://github.com/user/repo">` just works.
- **resolver:** `forge` attribute to override auto-detection of forge type (`github`, `gitea`, `gitlab`).
- **resolver:** `identity` attribute to filter to a specific DID when a repository has multiple identities.
- **resolver:** GitHub adapter — resolves `refs/auths/identity` and `refs/auths/devices/nodes/*/` via GitHub REST API, extracts public key from `did:key:z...`, reads attestation chain.
- **resolver:** Gitea adapter — mirrors GitHub adapter with `/api/v1/` prefix and configurable base URL for self-hosted instances.
- **resolver:** GitLab stub — returns descriptive error explaining GitLab does not expose custom Git refs via its REST API.
- **resolver:** Pure TypeScript `did:key:z...` to Ed25519 public key hex extraction (inline base58btc decoder, multicodec prefix stripping). Runs before WASM loads.
- **resolver:** URL parser with auto-detection: `github.com` → GitHub, `gitlab.com` → GitLab, unknown hosts → Gitea.
- **resolver:** In-memory cache with 5-minute TTL prevents redundant API calls when multiple widgets point to the same repo.
- **resolver:** Dynamic import (`import('./resolvers/index')`) — zero bundle size impact when `repo` attribute is not used.
- **resolver:** DID sanitization helper matching Rust `layout.rs` (`replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '_')`).
- **tests:** 29 new resolver tests — `detect.test.ts` (10), `did-utils.test.ts` (7), `github.test.ts` (7), `gitea.test.ts` (5).
- **examples:** `auto-resolve.html` demonstrating the `repo` attribute with GitHub, Gitea, forge hints, and identity filters.

### Changed

- **widget:** `#hasInput()` now returns `true` when `repo` is set, even without manual `attestation`/`public-key` data.
- **widget:** `verify()` resolves from forge before loading WASM when `repo` is set but attestation data is missing.
- **README:** Updated quick start to recommend `repo` attribute. Added new attributes to the attribute table.
